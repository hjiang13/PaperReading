Research Background

Problem to Solve
The main barrier of applying whole-system dynamic taint analysis in practice is the large slowdown that can be sometimes up to 30 times. Existing optimization schemes have either considerable baseline overheads (when there is no tainted data) or specific hardware dependencies. They try to reduce the overhead of DECAF

Key Design and Algorithm Proposed
High-level fault injection tool: FINJ
Machine Learning Faults classifier

Major limitation


Something you don’t understand
The features selected for ML is hard to understand

Your view on the research domain/topic/approach/data/solution (positive or negative)

This DECAF++ is an update of DECAF, and the main Promotion from DECAF is Elasticity. Whole-system dynamic taint analysis applications like intrusion detection systems and honeypots can greatly benefit from the elastic property. It is a Good idea for other taint analysis tools too.
